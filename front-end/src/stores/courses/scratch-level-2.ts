The same logic skills carry over into Python, but the blocks become typed code."

					title: "Optional Extra Practice: Typing Games",
					content: `**Purpose:** This resource supports the transition from Scratch into Python Level 1.

Typing practice is not required to complete the Scratch course, but it can make the move to text-based programming smoother. Choose games that feel useful, practice for about 15 to 20 minutes as needed, and move to the intermediate options if the beginner games feel too easy.

**Why it matters:** Scratch programs are assembled from blocks, while Python programs are typed. Keyboard fluency makes it easier to focus on programming ideas instead of searching for keys.

**Beginner typing games:**
- Practice with the Keyboard - Typing Letters: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/214833806/
- Practice with the Keyboard - Typing Numbers: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/214828609/
- Practice with the Keyboard - Typing Letters Race: https://www.nitrotype.com/

**Intermediate typing games:**
- Cup Stack Typing: https://www.abcya.com/games/cup-stack-typing-game
- Ghost Typing: https://www.abcya.com/games/ghost_typing
- Koala Paddleboards: https://www.abcya.com/games/spelling_practice

**Advanced typing games:**
- Typing Rocket: https://www.abcya.com/games/typing_rocket
- Type Racer: https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-2/tree/main/PS12-Type-Racer`
