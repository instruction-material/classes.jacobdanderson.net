Scratch string blocks make it possible to join text, read a specific character, and measure text length. Practice with `join __ __`, `letter __ of __`, and `length of __`. String length includes spaces and punctuation, not just letters. Good string reasoning always checks position and length: the first character, last character, an input that is too short, and an input with a space can all change the result."

				{
					title: "Optional Extra Practice: Typing and Code Fluency",
					content: `**Purpose:** This resource supports the transition from advanced Scratch projects into typed programming.

Scratch Level 2 already uses larger designs, lists, functions, and coordinated game state. Extra practice therefore focuses less on beginner keyboard discovery and more on maintaining typing comfort while translating familiar block logic into short typed-code patterns.

**Why it matters:** A student who can already plan a Scratch game still has to manage punctuation, spelling, indentation, and syntax in Python or JavaScript. Short typing warmups reduce that friction, but the main target is code fluency: recognizing how Scratch ideas such as variables, loops, conditionals, lists, and functions appear in text.

**Warm-up options:**
- Nitro Type: https://www.nitrotype.com/
- Cup Stack Typing: https://www.abcya.com/games/cup-stack-typing-game
- Ghost Typing: https://www.abcya.com/games/ghost_typing

**Code-fluency transitions:**
1. Rewrite a Scratch variable update as a typed statement such as \`score = score + 1\`.
2. Rewrite a Scratch repeat loop as a short \`for\` loop.
3. Rewrite a Scratch \`if touching color\` rule as an \`if\` statement with a clear condition.
4. Write a short function name and describe its input, output, and side effect before coding it.

**Stretch practice:**
- Typing Rocket: https://www.abcya.com/games/typing_rocket
- Type Racer project reference: https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-2/tree/main/PS12-Type-Racer/starter
- Choose one finished Scratch Level 2 project and write a five-line pseudocode version of its main loop.`
