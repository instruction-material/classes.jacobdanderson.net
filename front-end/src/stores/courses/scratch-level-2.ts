1. When the green flag is clicked, move the dragonfly to a random spot on the stage.

3. When the dragonfly is clicked, change its color.
4. When the spacebar is pressed, play a popping sound.
5. When 1 is pressed, make the dragonfly pop and then move to a random position.
6. When 2 is pressed, make the dragonfly say something, such as "Buzzzz".
7. When 3 is pressed, change the background.

**Extension:** Add another sprite controlled by the W-A-S-D keys.

3. Use a conditional for collision or survival logic, and update a variable exactly once when that condition becomes true.
4. Broadcast a game-over or round-complete message so every sprite enters the same ending state.
5. Add a replay path that restores the complete start state without duplicated scripts or stale values.

**Readiness evidence:** Run the project twice, test one repeated or ignored input, and explain the event-to-state-to-feedback chain for one collision.

						"Programs can store different kinds of data. Earlier variables mainly held numbers for scores, timers, movement, and comparisons. Strings store text: words, letters, spaces, punctuation, and other characters.\nA string can be thought of as characters connected in order. Scratch string blocks make it possible to join text, read a specific character, and measure text length. Practice with `join __ __`, `letter __ of __`, and `length of __`. String length includes spaces and punctuation, not just letters. Good string reasoning always checks position and length: the first character, last character, an input that is too short, and an input with a space can all change the result."

				},
				{
					title: "Optional Extra Practice: Typing and Code Fluency",
					content: `**Purpose:** This resource supports the transition from advanced Scratch projects into typed programming.

Scratch Level 2 already uses larger designs, lists, functions, and coordinated game state. Extra practice therefore focuses less on beginner keyboard discovery and more on maintaining typing comfort while translating familiar block logic into short typed-code patterns.

**Why it matters:** A student who can already plan a Scratch game still has to manage punctuation, spelling, indentation, and syntax in Python or JavaScript. Short typing warmups reduce that friction, but the main target is code fluency: recognizing how Scratch ideas such as variables, loops, conditionals, lists, and functions appear in text.

**Warm-up options:**
- Nitro Type: https://www.nitrotype.com/
- Cup Stack Typing: https://www.abcya.com/games/cup-stack-typing-game
- Ghost Typing: https://www.abcya.com/games/ghost_typing

**Code-fluency transitions:**
1. Rewrite a Scratch variable update as a typed statement such as \`score = score + 1\`.
2. Rewrite a Scratch repeat loop as a short \`for\` loop.
3. Rewrite a Scratch \`if touching color\` rule as an \`if\` statement with a clear condition.
4. Write a short function name and describe its input, output, and side effect before coding it.

**Stretch practice:**
- Typing Rocket: https://www.abcya.com/games/typing_rocket
- Type Racer project reference: https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-2/tree/main/PS12-Type-Racer/starter
- Choose one finished Scratch Level 2 project and write a five-line pseudocode version of its main loop.`
