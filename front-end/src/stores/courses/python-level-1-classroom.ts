Complete the **Normal** section first and test it without changing the shared framework. The **Hard** section is a separate challenge that can remain empty without breaking the project. Save a working checkpoint before attempting Hard so every student keeps a version they can demonstrate.

During a class share, show the finished result, point to the section you changed, and explain one prediction, one test, and one repair. Outputs and ideas may be compared, but every presenter explains their own Normal work before presenting a Hard addition.`

			content: `The completed framework draws three colorful circle bursts and keeps the reusable movement, fill, loop, and positioning code intact.

**Normal:** Complete \`choose_circle_color(circle_index)\` by returning one color from \`ART_COLORS\`. Use the index to alternate colors after one constant color works.

**Hard:** Complete \`add_burst_detail(x_position, y_position)\` with a center, border, label, or smaller repeated design. Keep all three bursts visible and avoid connecting travel lines.`,

			content: `The starter supplies the imports, color list, black canvas, Turtle object, key bindings, and event loop so the editable work stays focused on visible drawing functions.

**Normal:** Complete \`draw_square()\` so pressing S draws a filled square at the current position. Start with four equal sides and four right turns, then use \`choice(colors)\` for the fill.

**Hard:** Complete \`draw_bonus_shape()\` so pressing B adds a different shape, layered design, or short animation. The S key must continue working after the Hard addition.`,

**Normal:** Complete \`draw_triangle()\` with three equal sides and the provided turn angle. Add a fill only after the outline closes correctly.

			title: "Launch Project 4: Neon Trail Painter",
			content: `The finished controls already move, turn, clear, and draw a glowing trail on a black canvas. A fallback palette keeps the painter working before either student section is complete.

**Normal:** Complete \`choose_trail_color()\` by returning a valid palette color. Then try \`random.choice(TRAIL_COLORS)\` and compare the two results.

**Hard:** Complete \`add_special_effect()\` with a stamp, burst, shape, or short pattern for the Space bar. The arrow controls and C clear key must still work.`,

			title: "Launch Project 6: Spiral Galaxy",
			content: `The completed loop builds a mathematical spiral, changes colors safely, places stars, and updates the full scene.

**Normal:** Complete \`choose_star_color(step_number)\` with a valid color. Use the step number and remainder operator to create a repeating two-color pattern.

			content: `The starter builds the track, creates four racers, animates random movement, detects a winner, and supports a new race with the Space bar.

**Normal:** Complete \`choose_racer_color(racer_number)\` so every racer receives a valid color. Use the racer number to select from the provided list.

			content: `The completed framework plants flowers at click positions, draws stems and petals, supplies fallback colors, and starts with a small garden.

**Normal:** Complete \`choose_petal_color(x_position, y_position)\` by returning a palette color. Use one coordinate to make flowers on different sides use different colors.

**Hard:** Complete \`add_garden_detail(x_position, y_position)\` with a leaf, butterfly, face, grass, or another detail positioned relative to the flower. C must still clear the garden.`,

**Hard:** Complete \`add_victory_art()\` with a message, trophy, burst, or animation that appears only at the goal. The collision rules must remain correct after the addition.`,

For a project share, demonstrate the Normal result first. If the Hard section is complete, show it second and identify how it depends on the original framework. End by naming one Python idea used, one bug repaired, and one next improvement that would be safe to attempt.`
