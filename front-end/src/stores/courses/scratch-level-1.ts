**Stage 1 — start and movement:**
1. Start by playing the sample Hungry Hippo game and identifying the player sprite, collectable objects, score, and timer.
2. Create a custom version with a sprite of your choice.
3. Use the green flag to place the player at a predictable starting point.
4. Program arrow-key movement with direction and movement blocks.
5. Add one collectable sprite to the stage, but leave scoring, collision rules, and timing for later modules.

**Return plan:** Revisit this same project after coordinates, variables, conditionals, and broadcasts. Each return adds one tested system instead of building the whole game at once.

**Completion check:** The player starts in the same place, moves in four directions, and can reach the collectable. Explain which future feature will need a variable and which will need a condition.`,

Typing practice is not required to complete the Scratch course, but it can make the move to text-based programming smoother. Choose games that feel useful, practice for about 15 to 20 minutes as needed, and move to the intermediate options if the beginner games feel too easy.

**Why it matters:** Scratch programs are assembled from blocks, while Python programs are typed. Keyboard fluency reduces friction so more attention can go toward variables, loops, conditionals, and debugging.
